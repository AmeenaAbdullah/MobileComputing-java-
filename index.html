                    <b>Git.</b> You can use online hosts (such as GitHub) to store a copy of the files and their
                    revision history.
                    Having a centrally located place where you can upload your changes and download changes from others,
                    enable you to collaborate more easily with other developers. Git can automatically merge the
                    changes,
                    so two people can even work on different parts of the same file and later merge those changes
                    without
                    losing each otherâ€™s work!
