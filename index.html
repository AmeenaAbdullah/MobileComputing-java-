                    <b>Git.</b> You can use online hosts (such as GitHub) to store a copy of the files and their
                    revision history.
                    Having a centrally located place where you can upload your changes and download changes from others,
                    enable you to collaborate more easily with other developers. Git can automatically merge the
                    changes,
                    so two people can even work on different parts of the same file and later merge those changes
                    without
                    losing each otherâ€™s work!

        <div class="steps">
            <h2 class="headings"> STEP:2 Create a local git repository </h2>
            <p> Open a terminal(cmd) within a folder where you want to place the project on your local machine
              <br>  To initialize a git repository in the root of the folder, run the <b>git init</b>  command: </p>

        </div>

        <div class="steps">
            <h2 class="headings"> STEP:3 Add new file in repository </h2>

            <p>Create any type of file in git repo folder (eg index.html). Once you have added files in a folder containing a git repo,
                git will notice that  the file exists inside the repo. But, git would not track the file unless you explicitly tell it .
             </p>
             <br>
            <p> To add a file to a commit, you first need to add it to the staging environment. To do this, you can use the git add <filename> command 
               <br> run the  <b>git add < filename >  </b>  command: </p>
            <img src="./images/(add).png" alt=""> <br><br>
            <p>If you run the git status command, you'll see that git has added the file to the staging environment
                 (notice the "Changes to be committed" line).. </p>
            <img src="./images/(status).png" alt="">

        <div class="steps">
            <h2 class="headings"> STEP:4  Create a commit </h2>
            <p>
                Now Go ahead and create first commit.
                <br>
                Run the <b>git commit -m "message about commit"</b>  command.

            </p>
            <img src="./images/commit.png" alt="">
            <p>At the end of the commit ,the message should be something related to what the commit contains -</p>
