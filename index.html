                    <b>Git.</b> You can use online hosts (such as GitHub) to store a copy of the files and their
                    revision history.
                    Having a centrally located place where you can upload your changes and download changes from others,
                    enable you to collaborate more easily with other developers. Git can automatically merge the
                    changes,
                    so two people can even work on different parts of the same file and later merge those changes
                    without
                    losing each otherâ€™s work!

            <h2 class="headings"> STEP 2: Create a local git repository </h2>
            <p> Open a terminal(cmd) within a folder where you want to place the project on your local machine
                <br> To initialize a git repository in the root of the folder, run the <b>git init</b> command:
            </p>

        <div class="steps">
            <h2 class="headings"> STEP 3: Add new file in repository </h2>

            <p>Create any type of file in git repo folder (eg index.html). Once you have added files in a folder
                containing a git repo,
                git will notice that the file exists inside the repo. But, git would not track the file unless you
                explicitly tell it .
            </p>
            <br>
            <p> To add a file to a commit, you first need to add it to the staging environment. To do this, you can use
                the git add <filename> command
                    <br> run the <b>git add < filename> </b> command: </p>
            <img src="./images/(add).png" alt=""> <br><br>
            <p>If you run the git status command, you'll see that git has added the file to the staging environment
                (notice the "Changes to be committed" line).. </p>
            <img src="./images/(status).png" alt="">


        </div>
        <div class="steps">
            <h2 class="headings"> STEP 4: Create a commit </h2>
            <p>
                Now Go ahead and create first commit.
                <br>
                Run the <b>git commit -m "message about commit"</b> command.

            </p>
            <img src="./images/commit.png" alt="">
            <p>At the end of the commit ,the message should be something related to what the commit contains -</p>

        </div>


        <div class="steps">
            <h2 class="headings"> STEP 5: Push to GitHub </h2>
            <p>After commit , push changes to GitHub .This allows others people to see changes you have made.</p>
            <p>To push changes on Gihub , <b>git push</b> command is used</p>
            <img src="./images/push.png" alt="">
            <p>If you refresh the GitHub page, you'll see changes has just been pushed
                into the repository.
                File (eg index.html) added in your local repo is pushed on GitHub .</p>

            <h1 style="align-items: center; text-align: center; margin:0 auto;"><u> Create branch and push </u></h1>
        </div>
        <div class="steps">
            <h2 class="headings"> STEP 1: Create a new branch </h2>
            <p>Now that you have made a new commit, let's try something more advanced.
                If you want to make a new feature but are worried about making changes to the
                main project while developing the feature. This is where git branches come in. <br>
                Once you're done with the new feature, you can merge your changes from your branch
                into the primary branch.

                <br>
                Run <b> git checkout -b < mybranchname> . </b> . This command will automatically create a new branch and
                then 'check you out' on it,
            </p>
            <img src="./images/newbranch.png" alt="">
            <p>After running the above command, you can use the git branch command to confirm that your branch was
                created:</p>

        </div>


        <div class="steps">
            <h2 class="headings"> STEP 2: Push a branch to GitHub </h2>
            <p>Now we'll push the commit in your branch to your new GitHub repo.
                This allows other people to see the changes you have made. If they are approved by the repository's
                owner,
                the changes can then be merged into the primary branch.
                To push changes onto a new branch on GitHub, you'll want to run <b>git push origin yourbranchname.</b>
                <br> GitHub
                will automatically create the branch for you on the remote repository:
            </p>
            <img src="./images/pushbranch.png" alt="">

            <p>If you refresh the GitHub page, you'll see note saying a branch with your name has just been pushed
                into the repository. You can also click the 'branches' link to see your branch listed there.</p>

        <div class="steps">
            <h2 class="headings"> STEP 3: Open the pull request </h2>
            <p>Pull request (show in above screenshot ) is alert a repository's owners that you want to make some
                changes to their code.
                It allows them to review the code and make sure before putting your changes on the main branch. open the
                pull request</p>
            <img src="./images/openpullrequest.png" alt="" width="1000px" height="400px">
            <p>Click the create pull new request.After that , You might see a big green button at the bottom that says
                <b>'Merge pull request'</b> .
                Clicking this means you'll merge your changes into the main branch..</p>
